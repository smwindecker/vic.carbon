  abstract = {Wetlands have the ability to accumulate significant amounts of carbon (C) and thus could provide an effective approach to mitigate greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere. Wetland hydrology, age, and management can affect primary productivity, decomposition, and ultimately C sequestration in riverine wetlands, but these aspects of wetland biogeochemistry have not been adequately investigated, especially in created wetlands. In this study we investigate the ability of created freshwater wetlands to sequester C by determining the sediment accretion and soil C accumulation of two 15-yr-old created wetlands in central Ohio-one planted and one naturally colonized. We measured the amount of sediment and soil C accumulated over the parent material and found that these created wetlands accumulated an average of 242 g C m yr, 70\% more than a similar natural wetland in the region and 26\% more than the rate estimated for these same wetlands 5 yr before this study. The C sequestration of the naturally colonized wetland was 22\% higher than that of the planted wetland (267 {$\pm$} 17 vs. 219 {$\pm$} 15 g C m yr, respectively). Soil C accrual accounted for 66\% of the aboveground net primary productivity on average. Open water communities had the highest C accumulation rates in both wetlands. This study shows that created wetlands can be natural, cost-effective tools to sequester C to mitigate the effect of greenhouse gas emissions.},

  title = {Carbon Sequestration and Biogeochemical Cycling in a Saltmarsh Subject to Coastal Managed Realignment},
  volume = {120},
  issn = {02727714},
  abstract = {Globally, wetlands provide the largest terrestrial carbon (C) store, and restoration of degraded wetlands provides a potentially important mechanism for climate change mitigation. We examined the potential for restored saltmarshes to sequester carbon, and found that they can provide a modest, but sustained, sink for atmospheric CO2. Rates of C and nutrient cycling were measured and compared between a natural saltmarsh (high- and low-shore locations), claimed arable land on former high-shore saltmarsh and a managed realignment restoration site (high- and low-shore) in transition from agricultural land to saltmarsh 15 years after realignment, at Tollesbury, Essex, UK. We measured pools and turnover of C and nitrogen (N) in soil and vegetation at each site using a range of methods, including gas flux measurement and isotopic labelling. The natural high-shore site had the highest soil organic matter concentrations, topsoil C stock and below-ground biomass, whereas the agricultural site had the highest total extractable N concentration and lowest soil C/N ratio. Ecosystem respiration rates were similar across all three high-shore sites, but much higher in both low-shore sites, which receive regular inputs of organic matter and nutrients from the estuary. Total evolution of 14C-isotopically labelled substrate as CO2 was highest at the agricultural site, suggesting that low observed respiration rates here were due to low substrate supply (following a recent harvest) rather than to inherently low microbial activity. The results suggest that, after 15 years, the managed realignment site is not fully equivalent to the natural saltmarsh in terms of biological and chemical function. While above ground biomass, extractable N and substrate mineralisation rates in the high-shore site were all quite similar to the natural site, less dynamic ecosystem properties including soil C stock, C/N ratio and below-ground biomass all remained more similar to the agricultural site. These results suggest that reversion to natural biogeochemical functioning will occur following restoration, but is likely to be slow; we estimate that it will take approximately 100 years for the restored site to accumulate the amount of C currently stored in the natural site, at a rate of 0.92 t C ha-1 yr-1. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the content and composition of soil carbon in the laboratory is time-consuming, requires specialised equipment and is therefore expensive. Rapid, simple and low-cost accurate methods of analysis are required to support current interests in carbon accounting. This study was completed to develop national and state-based models capable of predicting soil carbon content and composition by coupling diffuse reflectance mid-infrared (MIR) spectra with partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analyses. Total, organic and inorganic carbon contents were determined and MIR spectra acquired for 20 495 soil samples collected from 4526 locations from soil depths to 1 m within Australia's agricultural regions. However, all subsequent MIR/PLSR models were developed using soils only collected from the 0\textendash{}10, 10\textendash{}20 and 20\textendash{}30 cm depth layers. The extent of grinding applied to air-dried soil samples was found to be an important determinant of the variability in acquired MIR spectra. After standardisation of the grinding time, national MIR/PLSR models were developed using an independent test-set validation approach to predict the square-root transformed contents of total, organic and inorganic carbon and total nitrogen. Laboratory fractionation of soil organic carbon into particulate, humus and resistant forms was completed on 312 soil samples. Reliable national MIR/PLSR models were developed using cross-validation to predict the contents of these soil organic carbon fractions; however, further work is required to enhance the representation of soils with significant contents of inorganic carbon. Regional MIR/PLSR models developed for total, organic and inorganic carbon and total nitrogen contents were found to produce more reliable and accurate predictions than the national models. The MIR/PLSR approach offers a more rapid and more cost effective method, relative to traditional laboratory methods, to derive estimates of the content and composition of soil carbon and total nitrogen content provided that the soils are well represented by the calibration samples used to build the predictive models.},

  issn = {0038-0717},
  abstract = {This paper is an extensive review of the research that has been undertaken on near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy applied to soil particularly for determining carbon (C) content. The objective is to determine which acquisition method (NIR, MIR, in the field or in the laboratory) might be recommended for the purpose of C stock measurement with a particular interest in carbon credit trading. For this purpose, an optimal method has to satisfy the dual constraints of low-cost and high throughput analysis. The various methods proposed in the literature are compared. In order to make comparisons as reliable as possible, special attention has been paid to the conditions of data acquisition (sample preparation), and to calibration and validation procedures. In particular, whether the validation has been carried out on fully independent samples or on samples similar to the ones of the calibration set greatly influences the results. Also, for C stock measurement, it is absolutely necessary to measure the bias of the prediction in order to be conclusive about the feasibility of the method. However, only few researchers provide this parameter and we recommend including it as a matter of course in future reports. Finally, although MIR on dried and ground samples is the most accurate method, on-the-go and in-field sensors provide predictions accurate enough to show promise in being a valuable component of technologies that would be used for C-credit purposes. But in order to meet the cost/accuracy trade-off, the main issue using such field sensors is to be able to simultaneously measure the bulk density or, better, to directly measure the volumetric concentration of C in soil. This circumvents the costs of field extraction and laboratory analysis. This is the next great challenge to be met by soil scientists.},

A novel application of 210Pb dating links the timing of this change with the introduction of livestock to Wellington Plain in the mid-1800s. Physical loss of material appears to have been the dominant process removing material as bog peats drained to form dried peats, as indicated by the mass balances of carbon and lead.

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) flux from wetland systems, both in their natural state and following drainage, has not been well accounted for in the carbon accounting process. We review GHG production from both natural and drained wetlands, and estimate the likely GHG emissions from these systems in Australia. Only a small number of studies have quantified GHG emissions from undisturbed Australian wetland environments. Consequently, in order to estimate GHG flux for Australia, it was necessary to collate data collected overseas from similar climatic zones. Using this approach, it appears that undisturbed, vegetated wetlands in Australia are likely to be net GHG sinks, with the greatest rates of sequestration occurring in mangrove ecosystems (\textendash{}2669 g CO2-e/m2.year) where biomass production is high but CH4 emissions are limited by salinity. The uncertainty surrounding these values is high, however, due to (a) the low number of measurements from Australia, (b) the low number of measurements for CO2 flux, and (c) the low number of studies where all GHGs have been measured concurrently. It was estimated that the drainage of melaleuca and mangrove forest wetlands in Australia would turn them from carbon sinks into carbon sources, and that in the first 50 years since drainage, this has increased global warming potential by 1149 Tg CO2-e or 23 Tg CO2-e/year. This is significant given that GHG emissions due to land-use change in 2007 totalled 77.1 Tg CO2-e. However, data surrounding the area of wetlands drained, carbon stocks in drained wetlands, and the effect of drainage on CH4 and N2O flux are limited, making the uncertainty surrounding these estimates high. Further study is clearly required if Australia wishes to accurately incorporate wetland systems into national carbon and greenhouse gas accounting budgets.},

  abstract = {Globally, there is little information on freshwater (non-tidal) wetland below ground soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, sequestration rates and, in particular, their within-wetland variation. This basic information is critical for designing programs to sample SOC stocks and identifying areas that sequester large amounts of carbon so that they can be managed to prevent degradation and carbon loss. Here, focusing on temperate seasonally inundated freshwater wetlands in south-eastern Australia, we compared SOC stocks and sequestration rates (via radiometric dating) among wetlands, within wetland locations (High water mark, Edge and Middle), and with adjacent terrestrial locations. SOC stocks varied most among wetlands but also varied inconsistently within wetlands. Wetland SOC stocks (20.4 6 0.1 kg C m22) were significantly greater than adjacent terrestrial locations (13.3 6 0.1 kg C m22). Wetland SOC sequestration rates were similar among all locations (i.e., within a wetland, ranging from 70 g C m22 yr21 to 87 g C m22 yr21). The relative lack of difference in SOC stocks among wetland locations allows for reduced within-wetland sampling and subsequently greater replication at the wetland level, at least for temperate ephemeral freshwater wetlands, although these findings need to be confirmed over a range of wetland types. This study also produced the first estimates of temperate freshwater wetland SOC stocks and sequestration rates in Australia, and is among the first studies globally to demonstrate that seasonally inundated wetlands can sequester carbon at significant rates. It therefore provides important justification to support the protection and rehabilitation of temperate freshwater wetlands worldwide.},

  abstract = {Environmental water allocations are used to improve the ecological health of wetlands. There is now increasing demand for allocations to improve ecosystem productivity and respiration, and enhance carbon sequestration. Despite global recognition of wetlands as carbon sinks, information regarding carbon dynamics is lacking. This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semiarid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha21) than ephemeral reedbeds (116\textendash{}138 Mg ha21). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. 13C enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m22 yr21) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m22 yr21). However, under current water regimes, rapid accretion at ephemeral reedbeds cannot be maintained. Effective management of persistent P. australis reedbeds may enhance carbon sequestration in the Macquarie Marshes and floodplain wetlands more generally.},

Of the three options of reducing the global energy use, developing low or no-carbon fuel and sequestering emissions, this manuscript describes processes for carbon (CO2) sequestration and discusses abiotic and biotic technologies. Carbon sequestration implies transfer of atmospheric CO2 into other long-lived global pools including oceanic, pedologic, biotic and geological strata to reduce the net rate of increase in atmospheric CO2. Engineering techniques of CO2 injection in deep ocean, geological strata, old coal mines and oil wells, and saline aquifers along with mineral carbonation of CO2 constitute abiotic techniques. These techniques have a large potential of thousands of Pg, are expensive, have leakage risks and may be available for routine use by 2025 and beyond. In comparison, biotic techniques are natural and cost-effective processes, have numerous ancillary benefits, are immediately applicable but have finite sink capacity. Biotic and abiotic C sequestration options have specific nitches, are complementary, and have potential to mitigate the climate change risks.},

  volume = {112},
  issn = {0168-2563},
  abstract = {[Wetland ecosystems have a high carbon storage potential as a result of high primary productivity and low decomposition rates dictated by water saturation. In the herbaceous wetlands of the Paran\'a River Delta, drainage and afforestation with poplars represents one of the dominant land uses. We explored the effects of these interventions on the volume and carbon storage of the young sedimentary soils of the region. At three sites we identified paired stands occupying similar landscape positions and soil types but subject to natural flooding and covered by natural herbaceous communities or drainage and flood control by dikes and covered by poplar plantations established 12, 17 and 19 years ago. Soil sampling at these sites revealed a reduction of the litter compartment (\textendash{}86 \%) and decreasing volume and porosity of its underlying mineral layer (0\textendash{}10 cm in the wetland reduced to 0\textendash{}4 cm in the plantation). Our comparisons of carbon storage accounted for these volumetric shifts by using accumulated mineral mass rather than depth as a reference, showing that tree plantations gained in the mineral soil (22 Mg C ha{$^{-}^1$}) almost as much as what they lost in the litter. These gains were particularly large at intermediate depths (4\textendash{}43 cm in the plantations) were soil porosity remained unaffected and C was raised by 64 \% explained by (1) the pulse of inputs from overlaying litter and organic layers subject to rapid decomposition and mobilization after drainage and (2) root colonization, since tree plantations had 75 \% of their fine root biomass at these intermediate soil depths, whereas roots in the wetlands did not explore the mineral soil profile and were completely confined to the organic layer. A neutral C balance following wetland drainage and afforestation resulted from the opposing effects of aeration, favoring decomposition in the organic layer, root colonization and organic matter stabilization, favoring its accumulation in the mineral soil.]},

However, there is little understanding of the quantity and distribution of carbon stored in our remaining wetlands or of the potential effects of human disturbance on these stocks. Here we use field data from the 2011 National Wetland Condition Assessment to provide unbiased estimates of soil carbon stocks for wetlands at regional and national scales. We find that wetlands in the conterminous United States store a total of 11.52 PgC, much of which is within soils deeper than 30 cm. Freshwater inland wetlands, in part due to their substantial areal extent, hold nearly ten-fold more carbon than tidal saltwater sites\textemdash{}indicating their importance in regional carbon storage. Our data suggest a possible relationship between carbon stocks and anthropogenic disturbance.

  abstract = {Palustrine wetlands (PWs) include all bogs, fens, swamps and marshes that are non-saline and which are not lakes or rivers. They therefore form a highly important group of wetlands which hold large carbon stocks. If these wetlands are not protected properly they could become a net carbon source in the future. Compilation of spatially explicit wetland databases, national inventory data and in situ measurement of soil organic carbon (SOC) could be useful to better quantify SOC and formulate long-term strategies for mitigating global climate change. In this study, a synergistic mapping approach was used to create a hybrid map for PWs for China and to estimate their SOC content. Total SOC storage in PWs was estimated to be 4.3 {$\pm$} 1.4 Pg C, with a SOC density of 31.17 ({$\pm$}10.55) kg C m-2 in the upper 1 m of the soil layer. This carbon stock is concentrated in Northeast China (49\%) and the Qinghai\textendash{}Tibet Plateau (41\%). Given the large pool of carbon stored in PWs compared to other soil types, we suggest that urgent monitoring programmes on SOC should be established in regions with very few datasets, but where PWs appear to be common such as the Tibet region and Northwest China.},

Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines. The procedures are also illustrated analysing data on plasma beta-carotene levels from a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States.},

Between 2004 and 2007, the Mexican National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) established a network of \textasciitilde{}26,000 permanent inventory plots in the frame of their national inventory program, the Inventario Nacional Forestal y de Suelos (INFyS). INFyS data served as model response for spatially extending the field-based estimates of carbon stored in the aboveground live dry biomass to a wall-to-wall map, with 30 \texttimes{} 30 m2 pixel posting using canopy density estimates derived from Landsat, L-Band radar data from ALOS PALSAR, as well as elevation information derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data set. Validation against an independent set of INFyS plots resulted in a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.5 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14 t{$\bullet$}C/ha  in the case of flat terrain. The validation for different forest types showed a consistently low estimation bias (\&lt;3 t{$\bullet$}C/ha) and R2s in the range of 0.5 except for mangroves (R2 = 0.2). Lower accuracies were achieved for forests located on steep slopes (\&gt;15\textdegree{}) with an R2 of 0.34. A comparison of the average carbon stocks computed from: (a) the map; and (b) statistical estimates from INFyS, at the scale of \textasciitilde{}650 km2 large hexagons (R2 of 0.78, RMSE of 5 t{$\bullet$}C/ha) and Mexican states (R2 of 0.98, RMSE of 1.4 t{$\bullet$}C/ha), showed strong agreement.},

  issn = {2151-3732},
  abstract = {Wetlands offer many ecosystem services, including the long-term sequestering of carbon (C) in soil. Here we present a study of C sequestration rates in a relatively undisturbed wetland landscape of southwest Florida. Accordingly, carbon sequestration was determined in four wetland plant communities and an adjacent hydric pine flatwood community that represent a gradient of inundation extent. Going from the wettest to the driest, communities were designated as: deep slough, bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), wet prairie and pond cypress (Taxodium distichum var. imbricarium). An adjacent hydric pine flatwood community was also included in the study as a reference upland site. Three soil cores were collected from each of these communities and were analyzed for total C content. Core samples were also analyzed for 137Cs and 210Pb activity to estimate accretion rates. C sequestration rates (g-C m-2 yr-1) were the highest in the deep slough (98 {$\pm$} 9) and bald cypress (98 {$\pm$} 5) followed by the pond cypress (64 {$\pm$} 7), wet prairie (39 {$\pm$} 1) and pine flatwood (22 {$\pm$} 5). These results suggest that impediment of decomposition by anaerobic conditions caused by prolonged wet cycles, may not account for all the variability in C sequestration rates observed in this subtropical setting. Instead, this variability could also be attributed to other factors like the quantity and chemical composition of the organic material reaching the soil. When methane emissions are taken into account, cypress-dominated (bald and pond cypress) and the deep slough communities act as net carbon sinks.},

  abstract = {Recently there have been major theoretical advances in the quantification and partitioning of diversity within and among communities, regions, and ecosystems. However, applying those advances to real data remains a challenge. Ecologists often end up describing their samples rather than estimating the diversity components of an underlying study system, and existing approaches do not easily provide statistical frameworks for testing ecological questions. Here we offer one avenue to do all of the above using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We estimate posterior distributions of the underlying ``true'' relative abundances of each species within each unit sampled. These posterior estimates of relative abundance can then be used with existing formulae to estimate and partition diversity. The result is a posterior distribution of diversity metrics describing our knowledge (or beliefs) about the study system. This approach intuitively leads to statistical inferences addressing biologically motivated hypotheses via Bayesian model comparison. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our approach does as well or better at approximating the ``true'' diversity of a community relative to na\"ive or ad-hoc bias-corrected estimates. Moreover, model comparison correctly distinguishes between alternative hypotheses about the distribution of diversity within and among samples. Finally, we use an empirical ecological dataset to illustrate how the approach can be used to address questions about the makeup and diversities of assemblages at local and regional scales.},

Because most nations lack wetland inventories, changes in the quantity and quality of the world's wetlands cannot be tracked adequately. Despite the likelihood that remaining wetlands occupy less than 9\% of the earth's land area, they contribute more to annually renewable ecosystem services than their small area implies. Biodiversity support, water quality improvement, flood abatement, and carbon sequestration are key functions that are impaired when wetlands are lost or degraded. Restoration techniques are improving, although the recovery of lost biodiversity is challenged by invasive species, which thrive under disturbance and displace natives. Not all damages to wetlands are reversible, but it is not always clear how much can be retained through restoration. Hence, we recommend adaptive approaches in which alternative techniques are tested at large scales in actual restoration sites.},

Total radioactivity was determined in whole soil and hydrolysates and in individual sugars. Fitting the data to simple exponential equations, total and 2.5 m H2SO4 hydrolysate radioactivity were best expressed by three part exponential functions, whereas radioactivity in 12M/0.5M H2SO4 hydrolysates and sugars were best expressed by two part functions, except for arabinose from the straw, for which a three-part function was better. A comparison of the fit was made with that using the single-term exponential expressions devised by Janssen, 1984 and Weibull, 1951 and with a modification of the two part exponential expression by the substitution of one term by the Weibull expression. Apart from the Weibull expression on its own, there was no significant difference between the expressions. It is suggested that, even for well defined carbohydrate components of the substrate, the decomposability changes with time because of their increasing inaccessibility to microorganisms, rather than that several components are present each with a different constant rate of decomposition.},
