Freshwater wetlands are globally significant reservoirs of soil carbon. Diverse vegetation, inundation regimes, geomorphology, and climate affect the amount and persistence of carbon in the soil in these ecosystems. Attempts to quantify the relative impact of these environmental drivers have relied upon datasets with only a few sites and a limited number of site-specific samples. Such data limitations led to an inability to model carbon density profile with depth, or include spatially variable predictors. In this study, we collected soil carbon data from 100 wetlands in Victoria, southeastern Australia, constituting one of the largest datasets of wetland soil carbon measurements from a single empirical study. These data allowed us to estimate the soil carbon density profile through depth using a curvilinear density depth response, and to integrate across that profile to generate a model of landscape-level drivers of carbon stock. We used this model to evaluate the importance of hydrology, geomorphology, climate, and vegetation structure using continuous spatial data. Our model of the soil carbon density profile demonstrates that, in general, organic carbon density decreases with depth, but that the shape of that decline varied considerably among wetlands. We found that carbon was highest among wetlands with intermediate levels of precipitation but with infrequent permanent water cover. The hierarchical model and out-of-sample prediction methods described here provide an analytical framework for future analyses of soil carbon stock in wetlands that guard against overfitting and enable appropriate extrapolation. These advances could be important for extrapolation used in global carbon cycle modelling, spatial conservation prioritisation of inland wetlands, and carbon offset and mitigation efforts.
